Twitter Congress is a simple python program I made to create Tweet @ Congress, a website to easily find and follow your Congressional Representatives on Twitter. The idea came from two concepts:

#Representative democracy is best served by a continuous, unfiltered dialogue between citizens and their representatives.
#Social networks such as Twitter are perfectly made to faciliate this discussion on a daily basis.
